# GAME-AND-GO
[11:50 PM, 3/25/2021] Nisarg Doshi: Game and Go is a fun game website developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website contains two games the first is the PIG GAME and the second one is the classic Tic-Tac-Toe Game

#. PIG GAME:- Essentially there are two players (player 1 and Player 2), the Player1 Plays first. When Player 1 rolls the die a random number between 1-6 is generated and adds up in the current score. The player can roll the dice continuously and the number on the rolled die adds up to current score untill one of the two conditions are met 1. If the player wishes to hold the score or if the die rolls up number "1", in the latter case the current score is turned to 0 and turn is shifted to the player2 and in the first case if the player uses hold button to stop his turn then the current score adds up to the final score. Like wise for player2. The Player who makes the final score of > 100 first will win the game

#. Tic-Tac-Toe (XO Game):- The classic XO game the its a multiplayer game the second person playing will not be the computer, instead it is meant to be played by two humans. The player who places his/her shape in the correct order wins!!
